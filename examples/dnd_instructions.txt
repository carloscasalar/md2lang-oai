Regarding D&D acronyms, translate:
- STR as FUE (Fuerza)
- DEX as DES (Destreza)
- CON as CON (Constitución)
- INT as INT (Inteligencia)
- WIS as SAB (Sabiduría)
- CHA as CAR (Carisma)

Keep game mechanics terminology in English when commonly used by the Spanish D&D community, such as "saving throw", "action", "bonus action".
